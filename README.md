# Spring4Shell
In this challenge, I analyzed the Spring4Shell (CVE-2022-22965) vulnerability, investigated security bypasses, and wrote an Incident Postmortem Report detailing the detection, impact, and resolution of the attack. I also implemented a firewall rule in Python to block malicious requests and prevent future exploitation.
